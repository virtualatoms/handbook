As a PhD student or post-doc, you\'re expected to attend at least 3 conferences or workshops a year. If you\'re a first-year PhD student then you\'re not expected to present. More experienced students or postdocs should apply for a poster or an oral presentation. If you find a conference that looks relevant to your research, email Alex with details of why you\'d like to attend. Alex will also suggest potential conferences throughout the year.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"group-policies/facilities":{"id":"group-policies/facilities","title":"Facilities","description":"This page has information on facilities available around the Molecular Sciences Research Hub.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"group-policies/holidays":{"id":"group-policies/holidays","title":"Holidays","description":"For PhD students, no more than eight weeks of holiday, including public holidays, may be taken each year.
