# Conferences

Conferences are a great opportunity to stay up-to-date with current research, present your latest research, and meet new collaborators from other research groups. As a PhD student or post-doc, you're expected to attend at least 3 conferences or workshops a year. If you're a first-year PhD student then you're not expected to present. More experienced students or postdocs should apply for a poster or an oral presentation. If you find a conference that looks relevant to your research, email Alex with details of why you'd like to attend. Alex will also suggest potential conferences throughout the year.

Once you've identified a conference and discussed it with Alex, remember to register as soon as possible. Most conferences have limitations on the maximum number of attendees and offer discounts for early registration. Also, pay attention to the deadline for poster and oral abstract submission so you don't leave it too late. Discuss your abstracts with Alex before submitting them. Don't wait until the last day, plan your trip in advance, and book accommodation and tickets as necessary.

### Expense Claims

Fill out the [Expense Claim form](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/finance/internal/expense_claim_excel.xls). Ask Alex for the account code (cost centre and activity/project number). Both you and Alex need to sign the form. When everything is done, send the form to [Ajimal, Perminder](mailto:p.ajimal@imperial.ac.uk) and CC [Ganose, Alexander M](mailto:a.ganose@imperial.ac.uk). Make sure you collect the receipts for each of these and then email them along with the spreadsheet.

The following are items that can be expensed: 
- Conference registration fee
- Accommodation
- Subsistence (meals)
- Transport costs: trains, underground, buses, flights, etc

Make sure you follow [Imperial's guidance](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff-travel-and-expenses/) for expense claims which details the maximum price of meals and hotels.
