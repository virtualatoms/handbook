# Conferences

There might be several conferences each year during PhD period. It would be a great opportunity to meet researchers from different groups and make some new friends there! Since most of them have limitations on the maximum number of atendees, do remember to registrate as soon as possible. Also, pay attention to the deadline for poster and oral presentation abstract submission in order that you do not miss any important opportunity. Don't wait until the last day, plan your trip in advance, book accomdation and tickets is necessary.

When everything is done, send to [Ajimal, Perminder](mailto:p.ajimal@imperial.ac.uk). Make sure you collect the receipts for each of these and then email them along with the spreadsheet.
