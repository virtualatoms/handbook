# Holidays

For PhD students, no more than eight weeks of holiday, including public holidays, may be taken each year. The college closes on 14 or 15 days per year, which are mandatory leave dates. Depending on how the public holidays fall, the [college closures](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-resources/leave/college-closures/) are different each year. Check the Imperial college website for more information. Discuss your holiday arrangements with Alex in advance.
