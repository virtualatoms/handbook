# Facilities

This page has information on facilities available around the Molecular Sciences Research Hub.

## Printer

Follow the instructions on the [installing printer drivers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/printing-photocopying-and-scanning/install-print-drivers/) page.
The printers can be found near the kitchen on each floor and are activated by tapping your ID card.
PhD students have an annual print allowance of £50, which will renew at the start of each academic year. 

## Shuttle bus

The shuttle bus is a good choice if you want to go to the South Kensington campus. Remember to check the [timetable](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/estates-facilities/travel/shuttle-bus/) in advance. It's free for students and staff – you only need to show your ID card when you get on the bus.
It's best to book in advance as you might not be allowed on if the bus is full. However, unless you're travelling at peak times, you should be fine to get on the bus without booking. The pick-up point is at the White City North car park.

## Meeting rooms

There are several meeting rooms around the offices on the 1st floor. Most rooms have capabilities for online meetings. Use [ChemiCal](https://chemunity.imperial.ac.uk/chemical/) to check meeting room availability. To book a meeting room, check the room availability and let Alex know the date and time you'd like to book it for. You can also use the lunch table on the 1st floor for quick meetings if it's free.
