# Facilities

This page has information on facilities available around the Molecular Sciences Research Hub.

## Printer

Follow the instructions on the [installing printer drivers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/printing-photocopying-and-scanning/install-print-drivers/) page.
The printers can be found near the kitchen on each floor and are activated by tapping your ID card.
PhD students have an annual print allowance of £50, which will renew at the start of each academic year. 

## Shuttle bus

The shuttle bus is a good choice if you want to go to the South Kensington campus. Remember to check the [timetable](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/estates-facilities/travel/shuttle-bus/) in advance. It's free for students and staff – you only need to show your ID card when you get on the bus.
It's best to book in advance as you might not be allowed on if the bus is full. However, unless you're travelling at peak times, you should be fine to get on the bus without booking. The pick-up point is at the White City North car park.

## Meeting rooms

There are several meeting rooms around the offices on the 1st floor. Most rooms have capabilities for online meetings. Use [ChemiCal](https://chemunity.imperial.ac.uk/chemical/) to check meeting room availability. To book a meeting room, check the room availability and let Alex know the date and time you'd like to book it for. You can also use the lunch table on the 1st floor for quick meetings if it's free.

## The Works

The Works is a contemporary eatery in the Sir Michael Uren building that will serve the White City Campus from breakfast until late. With a wide-ranging menu including gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options as well as daily lunch specials from around the world, there's something to suit every taste. Food will be available all day, whilst a hot food counter will serve breakfasts and daily specials. Take away options are available. The full menu is available to view: [The Works - Food and Wine Menu](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/food-and-drink/public/menu-pdfs/The-Works_Food-and-Wine-Menu-A4.pdf).

## The Hive at Scale Space

Located on the ground floor of Scale Space, it is the new local hub where you can find delicious coffee, a tasty breakfast and lunch menu, and relax in a cosy seating area. Open to all with free WI-FI.

## MSRH cafe

The MSRH Cafe in the Molecular Sciences Research Hub serves a range of lunch options, sandwiches, snacks and hot drinks. It is located on the ground floor, as you enter on the right hand side.
