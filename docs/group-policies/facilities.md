The shuttle bus is a great choice if you want go to the South Kensington campus. Remeber to check the [timetable](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/estates-facilities/travel/shuttle-bus/) in advance. It is free for students and staff – you only need to show you ID card when you get on the bus.
Its best to book in advance otherwise you might not be allowed on if the bus is full. However, unless you're travelling at peak times, you should be ok to get on the bus without booking. The pick-up point can be found at the White City North car park.

To book a meeting room, let Alex know the date and time you'd like to book it for and check the room is free in advance. For quick meetings, you can also use the lunch table on the 1st floor if it's free.
