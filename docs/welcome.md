# Virtual Atoms Lab Handbook

This website serves as the group handbook for the Virtual Atoms Lab 
at Imperial College London. The purpose of this handbook is to
act as a repository for knowledge in the group and to help
new group members find their feet as quickly as possible.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the handbook. Our newest 
members often have the most valuable insight and when Imperial policys
change there may be critical gaps in the handbook. At the bottom of
every page is an "Edit" link which will take you to GitHub where you 
can make changes. More details on contributing can be found on the
Contributing Guidelines page.

:::caution

This handbook is a work in progress. Please fix any typos or missing 
links you might find.

## About the Group

The Virtual Atoms Lab does research at the interface of chemistry,
physics, materials, and computer science. Fundamentally, we use
computational tools to discover, design, and optimise functional
materials, particularly for energy applications (photovoltaics,
thermoelectrics, electrolytes).
We are based at the Molecular Sciences Research Hub in White City in 
west London.
