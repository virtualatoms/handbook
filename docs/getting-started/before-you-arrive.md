# Before You Arrive

Welcome to Imperial and the Virtual Atoms Lab! This section gives a general guide on preparing to join the group. We list essential items you must finish before arrival, especially for new PhD students. Some might not apply to postdocs or visitors, so please refer to the Imperial website for more information.

**College Email**

Activate your imperial email account. After accepting your offer, you will automatically receive an email account and address. You might receive a notification email shortly before the term starts. Follow the instructions on the [Imperial support services](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/connect-communicate/email/) page.

**ATAS**

Remember to apply for your ATAS as soon as you get the offer! An ATAS certification is necessary for your CAS to be issued. Check [Imperial international support](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/international-students/visas-and-immigration/atas/) to check whether you satisfy the requirement for exemption. It may take more than one month, sometimes even longer. Fill out the [ATAS application](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academic-technology-approval-scheme) form and several questions related to your project. The CAH code is on the first page of your unconditional offer. The three most important questions are listed below. Discuss with Alex before submission. 

- What will you be studying?
- Why do you want to study this?
- What are your goals when you complete your intended program?

**CAS**

Your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies [CAS](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/international-students/visas-and-immigration/cas/) is almost there. You may need to wait for a couple of days to be notified. Log into [My Imperial](https://my.imperial.ac.uk) using your college username and password to review your CAS statement.
