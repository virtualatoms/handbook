# Your First Day

Welcome to Imperial and the Virtual Atoms Lab! You are now a member of our group! Congratulations!!! :)

Don't forget to say hello to our supervisor Alex (you can try to find him somewhere in MSRH building)! And remind him to add you to the "Virtual Atoms" imperial group (Slack & outlook).Visit our group [one drive](https://imperiallondon.sharepoint.com/sites/virtualatoms-CH/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=083c3a64%2D96d1%2D43b9%2Db244%2D1cc26fc0b800)  folder to find out files, videos and packages that might be useful for your future research. Feel free to upload anyting you want to share with the group! 

**How to find other group members**

At present, our group locates at the southeast corner of 109 Computational Modeling Lab. Go straight to the last row, three seats close to the window belong to Alex's group. Choose one table you would prefer, and there would be your seat for next a few years! 

*A small tip: make some noise when you try to approaching the seat closest to window, otherwise you might scare her!*

**Doctoral Academic Communication Requirement (DACR)**

Check [Imperial DACR](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/academic-english/current-students/doctoral/academic-communication-requirement/) page whether you fulfil the exemption requirements. Otherwise, DACR Assessments 1 and 2 would be necessary. You must complete Assessment 1 within three months of your registration date. 

**English Language Classe**

Check the [Centre for Academic English](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/academic-english) for more details about mandatory language courses. All students whose native language is not English must attend English Language classes in their first year. Remember to register for the courses on time; they close early each term.

**Late starter**

For those who start their study later than the beginning of the academic session, send an email to [PG Tutor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry/postgraduate/phd/pastoral-support/). They will arrange a meeting with you and explain the pastoral care available to you.
