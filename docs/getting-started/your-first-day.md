# Your First Day

Welcome to Imperial and the Virtual Atoms Lab! You are now a member of our group, congratulations! :)

Don't forget to say hello to Alex. You can find him in room 301E in the Molecular Science Research Hub. Ask Alex to add you to the Virtual Atoms Group Slack and [OneDrive](https://imperiallondon.sharepoint.com/sites/virtualatoms-CH/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=083c3a64%2D96d1%2D43b9%2Db244%2D1cc26fc0b800). The OneDrive folder contains files, videos, and codes that will be useful for your future research. Feel free to upload anything you want to share with the group.

**How to find other group members**

Our group sits in the far right corner of room 109 (the Computational Modeling Lab). Go straight to the last row, the three seats close to the window belong to Alex's group.

*A small tip: make some noise when you approach the seat closest to the window, otherwise you might scare Ruiqi!*

Now let's start finishing safety inductions. Here is a checklist to help you get started. You should have already completed

**Doctoral Academic Communication Requirement (DACR)**

Check [Imperial DACR](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/academic-english/current-students/doctoral/academic-communication-requirement/) page whether you fulfil the exemption requirements. Otherwise, DACR Assessments 1 and 2 are necessary. You must complete Assessment 1 within three months of your registration date. 

**English Language Classe**

Check the [Centre for Academic English](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/academic-english) for more details about mandatory language courses. All students whose native language is not English must attend English language classes in their first year. Remember to register for the courses on time; they close early each term.

**Late starters**

For those who start their study later than the beginning of the academic term (typically 1st October), send an email tothe [PG Tutor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry/postgraduate/phd/pastoral-support/). They will arrange a meeting with you and explain the pastoral care available to you.
