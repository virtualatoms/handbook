**Doctoral Academic Communication Requirement (DACR)**

Check [Imperial DACR](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/academic-english/current-students/doctoral/academic-communication-requirement/) page whether you fulfil the exemption requirements. Otherwise, DACR Assessments 1 and 2 would be necessary. You must complete Assessment 1 within three months of your registration date. 

**English Language Classe**

Check the [Centre for Academic English](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/academic-english) for more details about mandatory language courses. All students whose native language is not English must attend English Language classes in their first year. Remember to register for the courses on time; they close early each term.

**Late starter**

For those who start their study later than the beginning of the academic session, send an email to [PG Tutor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry/postgraduate/phd/pastoral-support/). They will arrange a meeting with you and explain the pastoral care available to you.
