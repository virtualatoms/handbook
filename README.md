# Virtual Atoms Handbook

This repository contains the content and code for the Virtual Atoms group handbook.
This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/). The page contents can 
be found in the `docs` directory and are stored as markdown files.

### Requirements

The website requires node.js to be installed. On macOS, this is simple if
[homebrew](https:/brew.sh) is installed. Just run

```bash
brew install node
```

Docusaurus and additional plugins needed for building the website can be installed through

```bash
npm install
```

### Local development

For development purposes, a local web server with automatic refresh is provided.
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window:

```bash
npm start
```

### Building the production site

To build the site for production, static content will be compiled into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service:

```bash
npm run build
```
